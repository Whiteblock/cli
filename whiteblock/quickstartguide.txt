Getting Started:

1. Build The Network
2. Configure Network Conditions
3. Send Transactions
4. Examine Data

Optional:
- Send Specific Commands To The Blockchain
- SSH Into Node

--------------------------------------------

1. Build The Network:

command: whiteblock build [flags]

flags:
  -a, --server-addr string      server address with port 5000 (default "localhost:5000")

This will create and deploy the specified blockchain with the specified number of nodes. Each node will be instantiated in its own container and will interact individually as a participant of the specified network. The blockchain will be built on a server that will be specified on build. 

The blockchain set up can be customized using the cli. The different customizations will be outputted to be added.

example: whiteblock build


2. Configure Network Conditions

command: whiteblock netconfig <command> [flags]

* available commands:
    * bandwidth
    * delay
    * loss
    * off
    * on

Netconfig will introduce persisting network conditions for testing. Network emulations such as latency, packetloss, and bandwidth can be configured and introduced to the network.

example: whiteblock netconfig delay 1 1 100

3. Send Transactions:

command: whiteblock geth send_transactions <tx/s> <value> [destination]

This will send transactions (in geth) with instructions on how many transactions per second to send and the value (in hex) to send. This will immediately begin transactions if the network has been built properly.

example: whiteblock geth send_transactions 100 0x545454

4. Examine Data

command: whiteblock get stats <command> [flags]

You may now go to the GUI and use our data visualization tools to examine the different data points that are being push directly from the blockchain. 

example: whiteblock get stats all

-----------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL:

Send Specific Commands To The Blockchain:

command: whiteblock geth <command>

Available Commands:
    block_listener          Get block listener
    get_accounts            Get account information
    get_balance             Get account balance information
    get_block               Get block information
    get_block_number        Get block number
    get_hash_rate           Get hasg rate
    get_recent_sent_tx      Get recently sent transaction
    get_transaction         Get transaction information
    get_transaction_count   Get transaction count
    get_transaction_receipt Get transaction receipt
    send_transaction        Sends a transaction
    start_mining            Start Mining
    start_transactions      Start transactions
    stop_mining             Stop mining
    stop_transactions       Stop transactions

This will allow you to send commands directly to the blockchain. This allows for more granular testing and data collection.

example: whiteblock geth get_block_number

SSH Into Node:

command: whiteblock ssh <server> <node>

SSH will allow the user to go into the contianer where the specified node exists. A terminal will be outputted to interact with the container.
